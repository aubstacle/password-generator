# Random Password Generator


## Description
Welcome to my Javascript Random Password Generator!! I was tasked with the challenge of creating a randomized password generator that sends the user through a series of prompts asking what types of characters to include in the password.

deployed application: https://aubstacle.github.io/password-generator/.
